# To run the project, execute the single_process_work.py file

# First, the site server is launched.

# Then the script recognizes the text from the images in the img folder.
# A folder is created from the first two words of the recognized text from the image.
# Image files based on the recognized text are placed in the appropriate folders.

# Then the script sends the files from the folders to the appropriate form on the site.
# The choice of which form to send the file to is realized by the match
# of the first letter of the name of the folder with the image file and the letter in the name of the form.
